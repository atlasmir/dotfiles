## macOS

Tested on macOS 14 (Ventura) with `zsh` version `zsh 5.9 (x86_64-apple-darwin23.0)`. Please note that compatibility is not guaranteed for very old versions of macOS, such as macOS versions before 10.13 (High Sierra) with `zsh` versions earlier than `5.3`.

*Note*: `setup-cli.sh` currently does not perform any operations on macOS.
